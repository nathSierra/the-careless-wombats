<h1>Night Owl</h1>
<p>This is a a full-stack app that uses MongoDB, Express, React.js, Material-UI, and the GoogleMaps API to find nightlife events that are happening in the city of Atlanta.</p>

<p>After logging in you'll be able to search three different locations for different categories of nightlife events.</p>

<p>It's a simple app, but it was fun to make it with my team.</p>
